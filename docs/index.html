        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This project attempts to implement a real-time fluid simulation using a technique called Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Everything is built from scratch in Unity with C# and Compute Shaders to create realistic fluid effects.</p>
        <p>For more details, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/ytyonly/DH2323" target="_blank">repository</a>.</p>

        <h2>Initializing Particles</h2>
        <p>
            The main idea of this implementation of creating a fluid simulation is to make use of a large number of particles (spheres in this case) to emulate the behavior of a fluid. In other words, what is done is to create the physics for how the particles should behave and by making these physics rules efficient enough to be able to run the simulation in real-time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step in doing this is to initialize all the particles needed for the simulation. This was done by generating the particle spheres in layers, organized into rows and columns around a set spawning point. The amount of particles to be spawned was not set since the simulation becomes better the more particles are used but since the simulation also becomes more costly the more are used it is highly dependant on the hardware the program is run on and therefore important that it is not a set value. These particles were spawned inside of a bounding box that was set up to hold the particles so they could interact with each other and not just separate. This bounding box was also made in a way so it could easily be changed in size in Unity since testing different sizes of the container could be interesting and reasonable sizes of the box vary a large amount depending on the amount of particles that are chosen to be spawned. Lastly, to make the initialization more natural all particles were randomly set a tiny amount off their original spawn location so that the particles were not all in a perfect grid at the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
            The result can be seen in the image below.

            <h2>SPH Explained</h2>
            <p>Before proceeding, we will provide more context regarding the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) interpolation method discussed in <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. SPH is useful for representing continuous field quantities with the use of discrete particles in space, by estimating the properties of the particles through interpolation of neighborhood particles based on the following general equation:</p>
            <p>
                $$A_S(\mathbf{r})= \sum_j m_j * \frac{A_j}{\rho_j} * W(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_j},h)$$
            </p>
            <p>Where given a particle at position <b>r</b>, we compute the field quantity of that particle \(A_S\) by iterating over all other particles and summing each neighboring particle's scalar quantity calculated from their mass \(m_j\), the scalar value at that particle \(A_j\), the density \(\rho_j\), and the smoothing kernel given by the function \(W\). The smoothing kernel controls the influence of a neighboring particle in calculating the resulting field quantity based on the distance between the current and neighboring particle \( \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_j} \) and the core radius \(h\). There are various smoothing kernel equations described within the paper this report is based on, the first is the \(W_\mathrm{poly6}\) smoothing kernel:</p>
            <p>
                $$W_{\mathrm{poly6}}(\mathbf{r},h)= \frac{315}{64\pi h^9}
                \begin{cases}
                    (h^2 - r^2)^3 & \text{if } 0 \leq r \leq h \\
                    0 & \text{otherwise}
                \end{cases}$$
            </p>
            <p>Intuitively, if particles are not in contact with one another, they should not be exerting any influence on the properties of that current particle. This is why the two conditional cases exist for when two particles are in contact or not. However, for different use cases and computations, different smoothing kernels are utilized instead which will be discussed later on for each subsection. The current smoothing kernel described will be applied for the Density and Pressure calculations for each neighboring particle.</p>
            <p>This equation will be useful in modeling the following field quantities.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="content-section" id="part3">
            <h2>Particle Movement</h2>
            <p>To calculate the movement of the particles thread groups were used to run the function once for every single particle. This function uses Newton's second law of motion which is shown in the equation below:</p>
            <p>
                $$F = ma$$
            </p>
            <p>where \(F\) is the force applied to an object, \(m\) is the mass of the object, and \(a\) is the acceleration of the object. This formula is rearranged to obtain the following equation:</p>
            <p>
                $$a = \frac{F}{m}$$
            </p>
            <p>This equation is then slightly modified to also get velocity which is done by multiplying with the timestep. Since it is used to calculate the next velocity of a particle, the old velocity is also added to this value which leads to the final equation:</p>
            <p>
                $$velocity = velocity_{initial} + \frac{F}{m} * timestep$$
            </p>
            <p>Then to obtain the next position of the particle with regards to its velocity, a form of integration is done by adding the velocity times the timestep to obtain the new position:</p>
            <p>
                $$position = velocity * timestep$$
            </p>
            <p>Something important to note about the timestep is that the smaller it is, the more accurate the simulation will be, however, it will run slower on the screen so the chosen number has to be set based on the hardware the simulation is run on. Another thing to consider when doing this calculation is also making sure the particle is not being positioned outside of the boundary box. This is done by having checks for each side of the box and if the particle gets to one of them making sure it bounces away from it by modifying the particle's velocity.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="content-section" id="part4">
            <h2>Density and Pressure Calculations</h2>
            <p>In order to compute the Pressure and Viscosity Force exerted by each particle, we must first compute their density and pressure. To do so, the paper <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> has outlined a variant of the SPH Formula we have previously discussed. The first step is computing the density values for each particle using the equation below, which considers all other particles:</p>
            <p>
                $$\rho_S(\mathbf{r})= \sum_j m_j * \frac{\rho_j}{\rho_j} * W(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_j},h) = \sum_j m_j * W(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_j},h)$$
            </p>
            <p>During the calculation, the smoothing function is also utilized and applied to the sum. For this, the poly6-kernel found in the paper <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> was used which was described earlier and can be found in the equation:</p>
            <p>
                $$W_{\mathrm{poly6}}(\mathbf{r},h)= \frac{315}{64\pi h^9}
                \begin{cases}
                    (h^2 - r^2)^3 & \text{if } 0 \leq r \leq h \\
                    0 & \text{otherwise}
                \end{cases}$$
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, by also utilizing another formula on each particle in relation to all other particles, the pressure is obtained from the density by utilizing the following equation, where \(k\) is a gas constant:</p>
            <p>
                $$p = k(\rho - \rho_0)$$
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="content-section" id="part5">
            <h2>Pressure and Viscosity Force Calculations</h2>
            <p>For calculating the pressure and viscosity force of each particle, the Navier-Stokes Equation is used which can be seen below, where \(g\) is an external force density field and \(\mu\) is the viscosity coefficient constant of the fluid. The most interesting part of the equation for this use case is the right side of the equation where the term with \(p\) is the pressure force and the part with \(v\) is the viscosity force:</p>
            <p>
                $$\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v} \right) = -\nabla p + \rho \mathbf{g} + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v}$$
            </p>
            <p>In simple terms, what the Navier-Stokes equation is used for is by transforming it using the general form equation seen in the previous section into formulas that can be used to obtain both the pressure and viscosity forces for particles. After doing these transformations, the equation that is obtained for calculating the pressure force can be seen below:</p>
            <p>
                $$f_{i}^{\text{pressure}} = -\sum_{j} m_j \frac{p_i + p_j}{2\rho_j} \nabla W(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j, h)$$
            </p>
            <p>While the equation obtained for calculating the viscosity force can be seen below:</p>
            <p>
                $$f_{i}^{\text{viscosity}} = \mu \sum_{j} m_j \frac{\mathbf{v}_j - \mathbf{v}_i}{\rho_j} \nabla^2 W(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j, h)$$
            </p>
            <p>After computing the forces, if we begin to render our project, the following simulation can be witnessed:</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="image/Project2323_render.png" alt="Rendering Particles in motion">
                <figcaption>Rendering Particles in motion</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>From the figure, the particles move within the areas confined by the bounding box in random motions which are computed by the quantities through the formulas we have discussed beforehand. The speed of the movement is affected by the timestep we have specified in addition to the hardware limitations of our computers used to simulate the events. The computations are demanding as the force computation requires a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) represents the number of particles we are simulating. Through this, we effectively simulate how the movement of fluid would be within the boundary box.</p>

        <div class="content-section" id="part6">
            <h2>Ray Marching</h2>
            <p>Now all physics-related steps of the implementation are done and the only part left is to actually see what is happening and make it look like a fluid. To make this possible, ray marching was used to make the large number of particles combine into a fluid. This ray marching shader was inspired by Sebastian Lague's ray marching shader which can be found in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp5WWtMoeKg">video on the topic</a>. The difference in this implementation compared to Lague's is to allow transparency of objects since the fluid is supposed to look like water and therefore transparency is needed. This is done by casting a ray and if the ray lands further away than where the water is, the water is of course transparent and the thing behind will be visible.</p>
